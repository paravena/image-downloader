# Image Downloader

## How to Build the Project

> The build tool I chose for building the project is Maven, the reason is because I'm more familiar
> with this tool than Gradle. I know Gradle offers more flexibility and capabilities those are not
> required for this small project.

> For building the project, execute following command:

mvn assembly:assembly

> The previous command will compile, run tests and package the application including all the dependency
> libraries. After doing this go to the *target* folder and you will find a file with a long name.
